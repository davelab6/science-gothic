# Science Gothic
## libre variable font

This repo is where development and updates to this project will (soon) be found.

Science Gothic is an OpenType Variations typeface (variable font) with weight, width and optical size axes. Ultimately it will also have a slant axis. While the medium weight is based closely on the original Bank Gothic typeface from the early 1930s, a lowercase, design axes and language coverage have been added. Bank Gothic was originally designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1930â€“34 for American Type Founders. Science Gothic is envisioned and led by Thomas Phinney.
