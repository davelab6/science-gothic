    "description": "Science Gothic is a variable font, commissioned by Google. Thomas Phinney was inspired by Morris Fuller Benton\u2019s  Bank Gothic (1930\u201334), created for American Type Founders. Science Gothic builds on and extends Benton\u2019s design by adding a lowercase, dramatic variation in weight and width, and a contrast (yopq) axis, somewhat reminiscent of Benton\u2019s Broadway (1927) and other period designs such as R. Hunter Middleton\u2019s Radiant (circa 1938\u201340) for Ludlow.",
