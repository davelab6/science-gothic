Science Gothic is a libre sans serif variable font commissioned by Google Fonts. Its wide design range allows it to take on many different looks and uses, striking or classy, from superheroes and detectives to cosmetics to business and technology. The basic design is based closely on Morris Fuller Benton’s Bank Gothic (1930–34) all-caps typeface for American Type Founders. Science Gothic adds a lowercase, extensive language coverage, and four design axes: extreme weight and width (much greater than the original), plus contrast (Y Opaque or ‘YOPQ’), and slant. Science Gothic is a team effort, by Thomas Phinney, Vassil Kateliev and Brandon Buerkle. Special thanks to Igor Freiberger for his early contributions.
